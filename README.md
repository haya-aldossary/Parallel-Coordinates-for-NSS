# Parallel-Coordinates-for-NSS

In 2012, Ipsos MORI conducted a National Student Survey in Swansea University, with the aim of tracking particular aspects of the running of the university such as teaching performance and student satisfaction, and to evaluate courses. This project examines the existing tools to draw a background image to create a suitable tool that assists this organization in exploring their multivariate data, and to provide them with fresh insight that might allow them to gain further information from their data. The resultant data from this visualization can result in easier identification of trends and greater data interaction without the need for time-consuming methods. The parallel coordinates visualization has been created as an excellent tool for this kind of data, and delivered with many features that increase its capacity and efficiency to overcome all limitations that have been found in both the existing tools and applications.
